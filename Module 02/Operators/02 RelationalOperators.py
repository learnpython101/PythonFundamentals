"""
Relational Python Operator carries out the comparison between operands.
They tell us whether an operand is greater than the other, lesser, equal, or a combination of those.

1. Less than(<)
This operator checks if the value on the left of the operator is lesser than the one on the right.
"""
3 < 4

"""
2. Greater than(>)
It checks if the value on the left of the operator is greater than the one on the right.
"""
3 > 4

"""
3. Less than or equal to(<=)
It checks if the value on the left of the operator is lesser than or equal to the one on the right.
"""
7 <= 7

"""
4. Greater than or equal to(>=)
It checks if the value on the left of the operator is greater than or equal to the one on the right.
"""
0 >= 0

"""
5. Equal to(= =)
This operator checks if the value on the left of the operator is equal to the one on the right.
1 is equal to the Boolean value True, but 2 isnâ€™t. Also, 0 is equal to False.
"""
3 == 3.0
1 == True
7 == True
0 == False
0.5 == True

"""
6. Not equal to(!=)
It checks if the value on the left of the operator is not equal to the one on the right.

The Python operator <> does the same job, but has been abandoned in Python 3.

When the condition for a relative operator is fulfilled, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
You can use this return value in a further statement or expression.
