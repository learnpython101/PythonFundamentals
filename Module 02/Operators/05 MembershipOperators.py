"""
These operators test whether a value is a member of a sequence.
The sequence may be a list, a string, or a tuple.
We have two membership python operators- ‘in’ and ‘not in’.
"""
"""
1. In Operator in Python
This checks if a value is a member of a sequence.

In our example, we see that the string ‘fox’ does not belong to the list pets.
But the string ‘cat’ belongs to it, so it returns True.

2. Also, the string ‘me’ is a substring to the string ‘disappointment’. Therefore, it returns true.

3. not in Operator in Python
Unlike ‘in’, ‘not in’ checks if a value is not a member of a sequence.

pets=['dog','cat','ferret']

'me' in 'disappointment'

# 3
'pot' not in 'disappointment'
