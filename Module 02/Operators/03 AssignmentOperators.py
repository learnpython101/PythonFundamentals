"""
Python assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. It may manipulate the value by a factor before assigning it.
We have 8 assignment operators- one plain, and seven for the 7 arithmetic python operators.
"""

"""
1. Assign(=)
Assigns a value to the expression on the left. Notice that = = is used for comparing, but = is used for assigning.

"""

a = 7

"""
2. Add and Assign(+=)
Adds the values on either side and assigns it to the expression on the left.
a+=10 is the same as a=a+10.
The same goes for all the next assignment operators.
"""
a += 2

""""
3. Subtract and Assign(-=)
Subtracts the value on the right from the value on the left. Then it assigns it to the expression on the left.
"""
a -= 2

"""
4. Divide and Assign(/=)
Divides the value on the left by the one on the right. Then it assigns it to the expression on the left.
"""
a /= 7

"""
5. Multiply and Assign(*=)
Multiplies the values on either sides. Then it assigns it to the expression on the left
"""
a *= 8

""" 
6. Modulus and Assign(%=)
Performs modulus on the values on either side. Then it assigns it to the expression on the left.
"""
a %= 3

"""
7. Exponent and Assign(**=)
Performs exponentiation on the values on either side. Then assigns it to the expression on the left.
"""
a **= 5

"""
8. Floor-Divide and Assign(//=)
Performs floor-division on the values on either side. Then assigns it to the expression on the left.
"""
a //= 3
